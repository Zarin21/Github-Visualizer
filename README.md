# Github Commit History Visualizer

- This React app generates a **vis-network** graph of the most recent 100 commits to a publicly accessible GitHub repository with clickable links to each commit.
- This project aims to visualize complex commit histories with several branches, merges, and other changes, neatly as a commit graph.
- A **parent node** is the commit right before the **child commit**, and a commit with several **child nodes** indicates the creation of new branches, while a node having several **parent nodes** shows that a merge has happened.
(Will include a more interactive UI)
